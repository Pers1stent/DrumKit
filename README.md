# DrumKit
A drum kit (also called a drum set,[a] trap set, or simply drums) is a collection of drums, cymbals, and sometimes other auxiliary percussion instruments set up to be played by one person.[1] The drummer typically holds a pair of matching drumsticks, and uses their feet to operate hi-hat and bass drum pedals.
